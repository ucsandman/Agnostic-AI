# Architecture

One harness, captured from the client you use, applied to every other client.
Zero-dependency Node; every engine runs on the standard library.

```

## Port engine (`engine/harness/`)

The contract every adapter follows is `engine/harness/README.md`. In short:

| Module | Role |
|---|---|
| `capture.cjs` | Picks the source client (`core/port.json` or auto-detect), runs `sources/<client>.cjs`, saves the bundle under `harness/`. |
| `apply.cjs` | For every installed target that is not the source, runs `targets/<adapter>.cjs` component by component (rules, identity, hooks, skills, agents, commands, mcp, permissions) through a guarded writer, saves `storage/harness-state.json` (ownership) and `storage/harness-report.json` (what happened, what was dropped and why). |
| `status.cjs` | Re-runs apply in check mode and renders the per-target, per-component matrix as a terminal table or a standalone HTML page. |
| `cli.cjs` | `capture`, `apply`, `port` (both), `status`, `explain`. |
| `bundle.cjs` | Load, save and validate the bundle; refuses to save a secret-looking value. |
| `toml.cjs` | A small TOML reader for the subset Codex's config uses (tables, arrays of tables, strings, arrays, inline tables). Writing goes through managed regions, never a serializer. |
| `common.cjs` | Guarded writes with backups and hand-edit detection, directory links, managed regions, frontmatter, secret detection. |
| `sources/` | `claude.cjs`, `codex.cjs`: read one client into the bundle. |
| `targets/` | `codex.cjs`, `claude.cjs`, `gemini.cjs`, `agy.cjs`, `cursor.cjs`, and `generic.cjs` for every rules-plus-skills-plus-MCP client. |

`core/templates/targets.json` is the registry: every client's home, rules
file, hook config, skills dir, agents dir, commands dir and MCP file, plus
which adapter renders it. `docs/targets.md` is generated from it and CI fails
when it is stale.

### Authored rules (`engine/sync/sync.cjs`)

If you prefer to author your working agreement in this repo instead of in a
client, `core/rules/global-rules.md` and `core/traits/traits.md` are compiled
by `npm run sync` into the primary client's rules surface (for Claude Code,
`~/.claude/agnostic-rules.md`, pulled into `CLAUDE.md` by an `@import` line).
The next `npm run port` then carries it everywhere. Sync uses the same
guarded writer semantics: backup before overwrite, hand edits are skipped
unless `--force`, `--check` exits 1 when stale.

## Hooks (`engine/hooks/`)

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `shim.cjs` | Runs a Claude-dialect hook under Cursor, Gemini CLI or Antigravity: translates the payload in, chains several guards (`++`), first deny wins, translates the decision out. Fails open so a broken guard never wedges the client. |
| `universal-adapter.cjs` | Normalises Claude Code / Codex / Antigravity / Cursor / generic payloads into one `{client, event, toolName, command, targetFile}` object for the shipped guards below, and serialises the decision in each dialect. |
| `secret-guard.cjs` | Denies tool calls that touch secret paths. Patterns come from `guards.json`; a built-in fallback list applies if that file is unreadable (fail closed). |
| `dashclaw-guard.cjs` | Scores the call (`calculateLocalRisk`) from `guards.json`. Below the query threshold: allow. At or above it: ask DashClaw if configured, else apply the local verdict. At or above the hard-block threshold with no reachable approver: deny. |
| `fable-delegate-guard.cjs` | Claude Code only. Briefs a Fable main loop once with measured delegation economics and logs large edits for `--report`. Denies nothing. |
| `capability-graph-guard.cjs` | Claude Code only. Enforces the subagent capability graph (Fable -> Opus/Sonnet/Haiku, Opus -> Sonnet/Haiku, Sonnet -> Haiku). Kill switch: `CAPABILITY_GRAPH_GUARD=off`. |
| `correction-tracker.cjs` | Appends user corrections to `storage/corrections.jsonl` for the harvester. |
| `dashclaw-setup.cjs` | Writes `storage/dashclaw-config.json` from `DASHCLAW_*` env vars. |

The shipped guards are installed into the primary client by
`engine/setup/first-run.cjs`; the port then carries them to the others like
any other hook.

## Harvest and distill

`engine/harvest/harvest.cjs` scans local agent logs (`~/.claude/error-log`,
`~/.claude/corrections.jsonl`, `storage/corrections.jsonl`, meditation
candidates, the learned-rules section of the rules) and writes deduplicated
records to `storage/candidates.jsonl`. `engine/distill/distill.cjs` runs the
promotion ladder and writes `storage/distill-digest.json` and
`storage/distill-PROPOSAL.md`:

| Tier | Meaning | Automated? |
|---|---|---|
| 0 Observation | a raw sighting | yes (harvest) |
| 1 Fact | repo-specific, repeated | yes: promoted by the distiller |
| 2 Rule | seen on 3+ distinct days; capped at 5 core rules | proposed by the distiller, **written only when a human approves** in the dashboard (or `--approve <id>`) |
| 3 Trait | a disposition in `core/traits/traits.md` | no: hand-curated |
| E Example | failure converted to a few-shot fixture in `core/examples/` | yes (`prune.cjs`) |

`engine/ingest/merge.cjs` pulls lessons from project-level `CLAUDE.md` /
`AGENTS.md` / `GEMINI.md` files back into the rules.

## Skills

`engine/skills/consolidate.cjs` copies skills found in each client's skills
directory into `skills/definitions/` (gitignored) and writes
`storage/skills-manifest.json`; `engine/skills/recommend.cjs` scores skills
per project. The port itself never copies a skill: it links each one from the
source client so an edit is live everywhere.

## Human surfaces (`tools/`)

All servers bind `127.0.0.1`. Mutating routes are `POST`, require the
per-process token injected into the page, and reject non-loopback origins.

| Tool | Port | What |
|---|---|---|
| `tools/sync/parity` | 7845 | The port status page: per-client, per-component matrix, dropped items with reasons, a "Port now" button. |
| `tools/dashboard` | 7842 | Command center: candidates, rules, skills matrix, project recommendations, routines, DashClaw settings, guard simulator. |
| `tools/recall` | 7844 | Search rules, memory files and decisions. |

Ports are defaults, not guarantees: on collision a server walks up to the next
free port (10 tries) and logs the URL it bound.

## Storage layout

| Path | Tracked | Written by |
|---|---|---|
| `harness/` | no | capture (the bundle; holds machine paths) |
| `storage/harness-state.json`, `harness-report.json`, `harness-status.html` | no | apply, status |
| `storage/backups/`, `sync-state.json` | no | apply, sync |
| `storage/candidates.jsonl`, `distill-digest.json`, `distill-PROPOSAL.md`, `corrections.jsonl` | no | harvest, distill, correction-tracker |
| `storage/deleted-candidates.json`, `prune-report.json`, `skills-manifest.json`, `skills-config.json` | no | harvest / prune / consolidate / dashboard |
| `storage/dashclaw-config.json`, `harness-installed.json` | no | dashclaw-setup, first-run |
| `storage/compiled/` | no | apply (the generic system prompt target) |
| `skills/definitions/` | no | consolidate |
| `core/**` | yes | you (and approved promotions) |

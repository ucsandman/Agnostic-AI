# Phase Design — slicing work that auto-chains cleanly

The goal of phase decomposition: hand the executor a sequence of **independently verifiable** units of work that compose into the full task. Done well, each phase has a clear "this is finished" signal and the next phase can start without re-reading the user's intent.

## How many phases?

**Whatever the task actually needs.** Phase count is derived, not chosen. There is no fixed range and no upper cap. Use these as loose orientation, not rules:

- **2 phases** — small change with a meaningful Polish & Harden pass at the end (one screen + harden; one API route + harden). Below this, you don't need Supergoal — just do the work.
- **3–4 phases** — small features, single-surface changes (one screen, one API route, one migration with tests).
- **5–7 phases** — typical features (foundation + core + integration + states/edges + polish, with a fork or two).
- **8–12 phases** — large features, full-stack greenfield apps, complex refactors that need a safety-net + staged migration.
- **13+ phases** — major migrations, multi-system rewrites, brownfield untangles. Don't combine just to hit a target number; combining hides dependencies.

**Two tests for whether you have the right count:**

1. **Each phase is independently verifiable.** It builds, typechecks, lints, and tests on its own; you could ship it as a partial increment. If a phase only makes sense once the next one is also done, merge them.
2. **Each phase delivers one coherent thing.** If you can't write its name in five words without using "and", you're packing two phases into one — split.

If you find yourself counting phases and trying to stay in some range, you're optimizing the wrong thing. Derive the count from the work; let it be 4 if that's right, 14 if that's right.

## Phase shapes that work

### The standard 5-phase shape (feature work)

1. **Foundation** — types, schemas, migrations, scaffolding. Builds but doesn't ship behavior.
2. **Core mechanic** — the central thing the feature does, working for the golden path.
3. **Integration** — wire into existing surfaces (routes, navigation, auth checks, etc.).
4. **States & edges** — loading, empty, error, unauthorized, offline; edge inputs.
5. **Polish & Harden** — copy, a11y, perf, security review, regression sweep, final QA.

### Brownfield refactor shape

1. **Safety net** — add characterization tests if coverage is thin.
2. **Extract** — pull out the abstractions you want without changing behavior.
3. **Migrate** — move callers to the new shape, one cluster at a time.
4. **Delete** — remove the old code.
5. **Polish & Harden** — final sweep.

### UI redesign shape

1. **Tokens & primitives** — design tokens, base components.
2. **Layout** — page shells, navigation, responsive grid.
3. **Content surfaces** — the actual screens, in order of prominence.
4. **Interactions** — animations, micro-interactions, state transitions.
5. **Polish & Harden** — a11y, contrast, copy, dark mode, motion-reduced, edge widths.

## Acceptance criteria — the test of a good phase

Each phase's acceptance criteria should be:

- **Observable in the transcript** — "build succeeds" is good; "feels right" is not
- **Atomic** — one fact per criterion
- **Falsifiable** — you can say yes or no, not "kind of"
- **Tied to commands or evidence** — `npm test` output, a file existing, a screenshot diff

Bad: "User authentication works."
Good:
- `npm run build` succeeds with 0 errors
- `npm run typecheck` succeeds with 0 errors
- Tests in `tests/auth/*.test.ts` pass
- `/api/auth/signin` returns 200 for valid credentials and 401 for invalid
- `<SignInForm/>` renders without console errors
- Authenticated middleware rejects requests without a session cookie

## Cleanliness (grep-checked at VERIFY)

Every phase's VERIFY block reports three grep-based counts against the complete set of added/new lines since the baseline — `bash <run-root>/repo-state.sh added-lines <Baseline ref>` (includes uncommitted + untracked work, not just committed; see `repo-state-comparison.md`):

- **Debug prints added** — `console.log`/`console.error` for JS/TS, `print(`/`pprint(` for Python, `print(`/`dump(` for Swift, `fmt.Println`/`log.Println` for Go (adjust per stack).
- **Session TODO/FIXME added** — `\b(TODO|FIXME|XXX)\b` introduced in this run's diff (not pre-existing).
- **Dead imports added** — new `import` statements with no usage in the same file.

Any non-zero count is treated like a failed acceptance criterion (3-strike). If a phase legitimately needs to ship debug output (e.g., a phase building a debug overlay or a logging integration), declare it in the phase spec with:

```
Cleanliness override: debug prints allowed (this phase ships <component>)
```

The override is read by the executor at VERIFY time and counts are reported but not failed. Keep overrides narrow — they're a release valve, not a default.

## Mandatory commands

Every phase must include the engineering commands the agent has to run and surface output for:

```
- pnpm build          (must exit 0)
- pnpm typecheck      (must exit 0)
- pnpm lint           (must exit 0, or only pre-existing warnings)
- pnpm test           (must exit 0, or pre-existing failures proven unrelated)
```

Adjust per stack. For iOS: `xcodebuild`, `swiftlint`, `swift test`. For Python: `uv run pytest`, `ruff check`, `mypy`.

If a command produces too much output to surface, require a **summary line** ("Tests: 47 passed, 0 failed") plus saving the full output to a file.

## Evidence required

For each phase, list what the agent must print into the conversation to prove completion. The evaluator only sees the transcript. Common evidence types:

- **Command output excerpts** — last 10 lines of the test run, build summary
- **File listings** — `ls -la` of the new files created, with sizes
- **Diff snippets** — key changes inline, not full diffs
- **Screenshots** — for UI phases, paths to screenshots saved during execution
- **API responses** — `curl -X POST ... | jq` outputs for new endpoints
- **STATE.md update** — the new content of the phase's row

## Dependencies

State them explicitly. Phase 4 depends on phases 1, 2 and 3 — not "the previous ones". This lets you reason about whether mid-chain interruption breaks the next phase.

Almost always linear (1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5). True parallel phases are rare in a single-session goal chain; if you find yourself wanting them, you probably want sub-tasks within a phase, not a parallel phase.

## The Polish & Harden phase — non-negotiable

Always the last phase. Its job: catch what the earlier phases missed because they were focused on shipping behavior. Required sub-passes:

1. **UX & copy** — every visible string reads well, no debug placeholders, no Lorem ipsum
2. **States** — empty, loading, error, unauthorized states verified for every new surface
3. **Edges** — empty inputs, very long inputs, special characters, slow networks (where applicable)
4. **Security** — input validation, auth checks, no secrets in client bundles, no obvious injection surfaces
5. **A11y** (UI) — keyboard navigation, focus states, screen reader labels, contrast
6. **Perf** — no obvious N+1 queries, no megabyte client bundles, no blocking renders
7. **Diff review** — final `git diff` reviewed for stray debug logs, commented-out code, TODOs from this session
8. **Regression sweep** — re-run the full test suite; manually exercise one or two adjacent features

This is where "every aspect is perfect" gets enforced. Without this phase, Supergoal is just a multi-step planner.
